AUTOCOMPLETE
-> when TAB is 1st pressed:
    -> if the 1st char is '\' and selectionStart<=(maxLength word from commandValues):
    -> stores what the user typed so far using slice(1,selectionStart)
    -> search for a match 
    -> store the matches
    -> adds the first match (plus a space) and stores the new selectionStart and added value
-> if the user keep pressing tab it will run through all the stored matched,
including what he typed (that was also stored):
-> if the current selectionStart=(stored selectionStart) and the current value
equals the stored last added value:
    -> takes out slice(1,selectionstart)
    -> adds the next stored match (plus a space) and stores the new selectionStart
-> else:
    -> it starts from the beginning
-> if the user types any other key, the stored values are cleared and
when user presses tab again it will restart the process
